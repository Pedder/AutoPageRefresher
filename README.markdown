Auto Page Refresher
===================

Testing websites on differente devices and browser is very important. But it's also very hard, if you use a lot of devices. Tools are coming for refreshing pages automatically - and there are some solutions with dropbox. But this solution based on:
- Webserver
- PHP

Grabbing the page, injection some code. That's it.

Just change the $url which you wanna check - and all devices will update the page.
